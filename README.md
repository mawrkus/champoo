# Champoo

Champoo is a lazy loader library.
By separating conditioners & loaders, it gives you the flexibility to easily load pretty much everything, the *lazy way*... It is extensible & has a small footprint.

## Installation

### Node

```bash
yarn add champoo
npm install champoo
```

### Browser

The package is available as a UMD module: compatible with AMD, CommonJS and exposing a global variable `Champoo` in `lib/Champoo.js` (less than 1Kb minified and gzipped).

## Usage

```html
```

```js
import Champoo from 'champoo/es';
```

See the `demo` folder.
